UAA has been installed.

**IMPORTANT:** You MUST update the following values in `values.yaml`
before using this chart in a production environment:

*   `admin.client_secret`
*   `jwt.policy.activeKeyId` and `jwt.policy.keys`

If you are *not* using the in-memory database (the default), you also
need to configure the `database` section with your database credentials:

*   `database.scheme`
*   `database.url`
*   `database.username`
*   `database.password`

To access UAA, you'll need to configure networking (e.g., Ingress)
to expose the `uaa` service.
